# Type System Discipline

Make the compiler reject impossible states, mismatched primitives, and unhandled variants. Prefer defining errors and special cases out of existence over proliferating handlers. Use the language's established type and schema tooling.

- **Brand semantic primitives.** `UserId` and `OrderId` are strings underneath but should not be interchangeable. Give each its own type, such as a branded intersection in TypeScript or a newtype elsewhere. Validate once at creation, trust the type downstream. Use distinct semantic types where mixing values is a plausible error; follow the language's conventions.
- **External data is untyped until parsed.** RPC payloads, JSON, IPC messages, CLI args, config files, environment variables, database rows. Have a parse function at every boundary that turns unstructured input into the typed model. The [boundary-discipline](boundary-discipline.md) says where to put validation.
- **Derive types from authoritative schemas.** When a protocol buffer, OpenAPI spec, GraphQL schema, database migration, design-token file, or another file owns a shape, derive from it instead of hand-rolling a parallel type. See the [encode-lessons-in-structure](encode-lessons-in-structure.md).
